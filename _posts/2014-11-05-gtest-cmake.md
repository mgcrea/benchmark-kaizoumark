Continuous integration requires a robust test environment to be able to detect regressions as early as possible.

A typical test environment will typically be composed of integration tests of the whole system and unit tests per components.

This post explains how to create unit tests for a `C++` component using [__GoogleTest__](https://github.com/google/googletest) and [__CMake__](http://www.cmake.org/).

##Project structure

I will assume here that the project structure follows the model described in a [previous post](/2014/11/typical-cmake-project/):

~~~
+-- CMakeLists.txt
+-- main
|    +-- CMakeLists
|    +-- main.cpp
|
+-- test
|    +-- CMakeLists.txt
|    +-- testfoo
|       +-- CMakeLists.txt
|       +-- main.cpp
|       +-- testfoo.h
|       +-- testfoo.cpp
|       +-- mockbar.h
|
+-- libfoo
|    +-- CMakeLists.txt
|    +-- foo.h
|    +-- foo.cpp
|
+-- libbar
     +-- CMakeLists.txt
     +-- bar.h
     +-- bar.cpp

~~~

The `main` subdirectory contains the main project target, an executable providing the super-useful `libfoo` service using the awesome `libbar` backend (for example `libfoo` could be a generic face recognition library and `libbar` a GPU-based image processing library).

The `test` directory contains a single executable allowing to test the `libfoo` service using a _mock_ version of `libbar`.

>From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object): In object-oriented programming, mock objects are simulated objects that mimic the behavior of real objects in controlled ways.

For those interested, the code for this sample project is on [github](https://github.com/kaizouman/gtest-cmake-example).

##A closer look at the test directory

In my simplistic example, there is only one subdirectory under `test`, but in a typical project, it would contain several subdirectories, one for each test program.

Tests programs are based on Google's [Googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/docs/Primer.md) framework and its [GoogleMock](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googlemock/README.md) extension.

Since all test programs will be using these packages, the root `CMakeLists.txt` file should contain all directives required to resolve the corresponding dependencies. This is where things get a bit hairy, since Google [does not recommend to install these packages in binary form](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest/docs/FAQ.md), but instead to recompile them with your project.

###Resolving GoogleTest and GoogleMock dependencies

There are at least three options to integrate your project with __GoogleTest__ and __GoogleMock__.

####Having both packages integrated in your build system

Obviously, this is only an option if you actually _do_ have a buildsystem, but if this is the case, this would be my recommendation.

Depending on how your buildsystem is structured, your mileage may vary, but in the end you should be able to declare __GoogleTest__ and __GoogleMock__ as dependencies using `CMake` functions like the built-in `find_package` or the `pkg-config` based `pkg_check_modules`.

~~~
find_package(PkgConfig)
pkg_check_modules(GTEST REQUIRED gtest>=1.7.0)
pkg_check_modules(GMOCK REQUIRED gmock>=1.7.0)

include_directories(
    ${GTEST_INCLUDE_DIRS}
    ${GMOCK_INCLUDE_DIRS}
)
~~~

####Add both packages sources to your project

Adding the __GoogleTest__ and __GoogleMock__ sources as subdirectories of `test` would allow you to compile them as part of your project.

This is however really ugly, and I wouldn't recommend you doing that ...

####Add both packages as external CMake projects

According to various answers posted on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9689183/cmake-googletest), this seems to be the recommended way of resolving __GoogleTest__ and __GoogleMock__ dependencies on a per project basis.

It takes advantage of the `CMake` `ExternalProject` module to fetch __GoogleTest__ and __GoogleMock__ sources from the internet and compile them as third-party dependencies in your project.

Below is a working example, with a few comments explaining what's going on: 

~~~
# We need thread support
find_package(Threads REQUIRED)

# Enable ExternalProject CMake module
include(ExternalProject)

# Download and install GoogleTest
ExternalProject_Add(
    gtest
    URL https://github.com/google/googletest/archive/master.zip
    PREFIX ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/gtest
    # Disable install step
    INSTALL_COMMAND ""
)

# Get GTest source and binary directories from CMake project
ExternalProject_Get_Property(gtest source_dir binary_dir)

# Create a libgtest target to be used as a dependency by test programs
add_library(libgtest IMPORTED STATIC GLOBAL)
add_dependencies(libgtest gtest)

# Set libgtest properties
set_target_properties(libgtest PROPERTIES
    "IMPORTED_LOCATION" "${binary_dir}/googlemock/gtest/libgtest.a"
    "IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES" "${CMAKE_THREAD_LIBS_INIT}"
)

# Create a libgmock target to be used as a dependency by test programs
add_library(libgmock IMPORTED STATIC GLOBAL)
add_dependencies(libgmock gtest)

# Set libgmock properties
set_target_properties(libgmock PROPERTIES
    "IMPORTED_LOCATION" "${binary_dir}/googlemock/libgmock.a"
    "IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES" "${CMAKE_THREAD_LIBS_INIT}"
)

# I couldn't make it work with INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
include_directories("${source_dir}/googletest/include"
                    "${source_dir}/googlemock/include")
~~~

>Note: It should theoretically be possible to set the __GoogleTest__ and __GoogleMock__ include directories as target properties using the INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES variable, but it fails because these directoires don't exist yet when they are declared. As a workaround, I had to explicitly use include_directories to specify them.

###Writing a __testfoo__ test program for __libfoo__

The __testfoo__ program depends on __libfoo__, __GoogleTest__ and __GoogleMock__. 

Here is how the __testfoo__ `CMakeLists.txt` file would look like:

~~~~
file(GLOB SRCS *.cpp)

add_executable(testfoo ${SRCS})

target_link_libraries(testfoo
    libfoo
    libgtest
    libgmock
)

install(TARGETS testfoo DESTINATION bin)
~~~~

The libraries required for the build are listed under `target_link_libraries`.
CMake will then add the appropriate include directories and link options.

The __testfoo__ program will provide unit tests for the `Foo` class of the __libfoo__ library defined below.

####`foo.h`
~~~
class Bar;

class Foo
{
    Foo(const Bar& bar);
    bool baz(bool useQux);
protected:
    const Bar& m_bar;
}
~~~

####`foo.cpp`

~~~
#include "bar.h"
#include "foo.h"

Foo::Foo(const bar& bar)
 : m_bar(bar) {};

bool Foo::baz(bool useQux) {
    if (useQux) {
        return m_bar.qux();
    } else {
        return m_bar.norf();
    }
}
~~~

The sample Test program described in the [GoogleTest Documentation](http://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/Primer) fits in a single file, but I prefer splitting the Unit Tests code in three types of files.

###`main.cpp`

The `main.cpp` file will contain only the test program `main` function.
This is where you will put the generic __Googletest__ Macro invocation to launch the tests and some initializations that need to be put in the `main` (nothing in this particular case).

~~~
#include "gtest/gtest.h"

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    ::testing::InitGoogleTest(&argc, argv);
    int ret = RUN_ALL_TESTS();
    return ret;
}
~~~

###`testfoo.h`

This file contains the declaration of the `FooTest` class, which is the test fixture for the `Foo` class.

~~~
#include "gtest/gtest.h"
#include "mockbar.h"

// The fixture for testing class Foo.
class FooTest : public ::testing::Test {

protected:

    // You can do set-up work for each test here.
    FooTest();

    // You can do clean-up work that doesn't throw exceptions here.
    virtual ~FooTest();

    // If the constructor and destructor are not enough for setting up
    // and cleaning up each test, you can define the following methods:

    // Code here will be called immediately after the constructor (right
    // before each test).
    virtual void SetUp();

    // Code here will be called immediately after each test (right
    // before the destructor).
    virtual void TearDown();

    // The mock bar library shaed by all tests
    MockBar m_bar;
};
~~~

###`mockbar.h`

Assuming the __libbar__ library implements a public `Bar` interface, we use __GoogleMock__ to provide a fake implementation for test purposes only:

~~~
#include "bar.h"

class MockBar: public Bar
{
    MOCK_METHOD0(qux, bool());
    MOCK_METHOD0(norf, bool());
} 
~~~

This will allow us to inject controlled values into the __libfoo__ library when it will invoke the `Bar` class methods.

>Please refer to the [GoogleMock documentation](http://code.google.com/p/googlemock/wiki/V1_7_ForDummies) for a detailed description of the `GoogleMock` features.

###`testfoo.cpp`

This file contains the implementation of the `TestFoo` fixture class.

This is where the actual tests are written.

We will test the output of the `Foo::baz()` method, first having default values for the `Bar::qux()` and `Bar::norf()` methods returned by our mock, then overrding the value returned by `Bar::norf()` with a value specific to our test.

In all test cases, we use __GoogleTest__ expectations to verify the output of the `Foo::baz` method.

~~~
#include "mockbar.h"
#include "testfoo.h"

using ::testing::Return;

FooTest()
{
    // Have qux return true by default
    ON_CALL(m_bar,qux()).WillByDefault(Return(true));
    // Have norf return false by default
    ON_CALL(m_bar,norf()).WillByDefault(Return(false));
}

TEST_F(FooTest, ByDefaultBazTrueIsTrue) {
    Foo foo(m_bar);
    EXPECT_EQ(foo.baz(true), true);
}

TEST_F(FooTest, ByDefaultBazFalseIsFalse) {
    Foo foo(m_bar);
    EXPECT_EQ(foo.baz(false), false);
}

TEST_F(FooTest, SometimesBazFalseIsTrue) {
    Foo foo(m_bar);
    // Have norf return true for once
    EXPECT_CALL(m_bar,norf()).WillOnce(Return(true));
    EXPECT_EQ(foo.baz(false), false);
}

~~~

>Please refer to the [GoogleTest documentation](http://code.google.com/p/googletest/wiki/Primer) for a much detailed presentation of how to create unit tests with Gtest.

##Building tests

As usual, it is recommended to build your program out-of-tree, ie in a directory separated from the sources.

~~~
mkdir build
cd build
~~~

First, you need to invoke the `cmake` command to generate the build files.

~~~
cmake ..
~~~

This should produce an output similar to this one:

~~~

-- Check for working C compiler: /usr/bin/cc
-- Check for working C compiler: /usr/bin/cc -- works

~~~

Then, build the project targets.

~~~
make
~~~

The following output corresponds to the case where __GoogleTest__ and __GoogleMock__ are automatically fetched from their repositories and built as third-party dependencies.
