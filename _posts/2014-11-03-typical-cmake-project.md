When it comes to choosing a make system on Linux, you basically only have two options: autotools or CMake. I have always found Autotools a bit counter-intuitive, but was reluctant to make the effort to switch to CMake because I was worried the learning curve would be too steep for a task you don't have to perform that much often (I mean, you usually spend more time writing code than writing build rules).

A recent project of mine required writing a lot of new Linux packages, and I decided it was a good time to give CMake a try. This article is about how I have used it to build plain old Linux packages almost effortlessly.

<!--more-->

Although CMake is fairly well documented, I personnally found the documentation (and especially the tutorial) a bit too CMake-oriented, forcing me to use cmake dedicated tools for tasks I had already tools for (tests and delivery for instance).

This is therefore my own tutorial to CMake, based on my primary requirement: just generate the makefiles using CMake, and use my own tools for everything else.

## Project structure

The project structure is partly driven by the project design, but it would ususally contain at least two common sub-directories, along with several "module" sub-directories:

    main
    test
    moduleA
    moduleB
    ...

The `main` subdirectory contains the main project target, typically an executable.

The `test` directory contains one or more test executables.

The `moduleX` directories contain libraries to be used by either the tests or main executables.

At the root of the project, the main ``CMakeLists.txt`` should contain the common CMake directives that apply to all subdirectories.

First, the ``CMakeLists.txt`` would specify a minimum Cmake version, name your project and define a few common behaviours.

    CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED(VERSION 2.8)

    PROJECT(MyProject)

    SET(CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR ON)

Here, I only set one option that is of uttermost importance if you want to build out-of-tree AND generate some of your source files automatically (you most certainly do actually if you are using ANY modern framework like Qt). What it does is that it adds the `${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}` (this one you don't care that much) and `${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}` to the include path, allowing generated include files to be found by the compiler.

Finally, the ``CMakeLists.txt`` would list all subdirectories to be included in the project:

    ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(main)
    ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(test)
    ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(moduleA)
    ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(moduleB)
    ...

## Configuring Modules

As explained in the previous paragraph, each subdirectory would contain at least either one executable or one library defined in a dedicated ``CMakeLists.txt`` file.

Executables are declared using the [`ADD_EXECUTABLE`](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/command/add_executable.html#command:add_executable) command:

    ADD_EXECUTABLE(myapp
        ${MY_SRCS}
    )

Libraries are declared using the [`ADD_LIBRARY`](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/command/add_library.html#command:add_library) command: 
  
    ADD_LIBRARY(mylib STATIC
        ${MY_SRCS}
    )

Source files are specified either explicitly or using a wildcard:

    SET(MY_SRC
        fileA.cpp
        fileB.cpp
        ...
    )

or

    file(GLOB MY_SRC
        "*.h"
        "*.cpp"
    )

> Note that using a wildcard, you need to rerun CMake if you add more files to a module

## Solving dependencies between modules

### Link dependencies

Link dependencies between modules are solved using the [`TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES`](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/command/target_link_libraries.html) command.

CMake maintains throughout the whole project a named object for each target created by a command such as `ADD_EXECUTABLE()` or `ADD_LIBRARY()`.

This target name can be passed to the [`TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES`](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/command/target_link_libraries.html) command to tell CMake that an object A depends on on object B.

Example:

Given a library defined in a specific subdirectory

    ADD_LIBRARY(mylib STATIC
        ${MY_LIBSRCS}
    )

One can specify a dependency from an application to that library

    ADD_EXECUTABLE(myapp
        ${MY_APPSRCS}
    )

    TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(myapp
        mylib
    )

### Include dependencies

Include dependencies are automatically solved for dependent libraries declared in the [`TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES`](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/command/target_link_libraries.html) command if the corresponding libraries have properly declared their include directories using the [`TARGET_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/command/target_include_directories.html) command.

Example:

Given a library defined in a specific subdirectory

    ADD_LIBRARY(mylib STATIC
        ${MY_LIBSRCS}
    )

Specifying 

    TARGET_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(mylib
        /path/to/includes
    )

Allows a dependent app to be aware of the mylib include path just when adding the lib to the `TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES`

    ADD_EXECUTABLE(myapp
        ${MY_APPSRCS}
    )

    TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(myapp
        mylib
    )

Additional include dependencies can be solved explicitly using the [`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/command/include_directories.html) command, but most of the time, you won't need it unless you have nested sub-directories that don't have a `CMakeLists.txt` of their own (as a matter of fact, needing to add an explicit `INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` may be a good hint that something is wrong with your other directives).

## Resolving Dependencies towards external packages

### Packages known by CMake

CMake provides a set of tools to register and retrieve information about packages stored in a CMake package registry.

CMake packages dependencies are solved easily by specifying them using the built-in CMake `FIND_PACKAGE` commands.

    FIND_PACKAGE(Qt5Core)

This command will create a CMake target Qt5::Core that can be referenced in [`TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES`](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/command/target_link_libraries.html) commands.

    ADD_LIBRARY(mylib STATIC
        ${MY_LIBSRCS}
    )

    TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(mylib
        Qt5::Core
    )

>Note: The `FIND_PACKAGE` command will also export [several related variables](http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5/cmake-manual.html#variable-reference).

Just like when referencing an internal module, the paths to the specific includes of libraries found using `FIND_PACKAGE` are automatically added to the include search path. There is therefore no need to add them explicitly using an `INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` directive.

### Other packages: pkg-config

For package whose definition is not maintained in CMake (ie there is no FIND_PACKAGE macro written for them), you may rely on the generic pkg-config tool instead.

[pkg-config](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/) is a helper tool used when compiling applications and libraries. It helps you insert the correct compiler options on the command line so an application can use `gcc -o test test.c pkg-config --libs --cflags glib-2.0` for instance, rather than hard-coding values on where to find glib (or other libraries). It is language-agnostic, so it can be used for defining the location of documentation tools, for instance.

pkg-config compatible packages declare their include path, compiler options and linking flags in dedicated `.pc` files installed on the system.

Here is for instance the `glib-2.0` pkg-configfile:

    prefix=/usr
    exec_prefix=${prefix}
    libdir=${prefix}/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
    includedir=${prefix}/include
    
    glib_genmarshal=glib-genmarshal
    gobject_query=gobject-query
    glib_mkenums=glib-mkenums
    
    Name: GLib
    Description: C Utility Library
    Version: 2.36.0
    Requires.private: libpcre
    Libs: -L${libdir} -lglib-2.0 
    Libs.private: -pthread  -lpcre    
    Cflags: -I${includedir}/glib-2.0 -I${libdir}/glib-2.0/include

Before using pkg-config, you need to make sure the tool is available by inserting the following line in your ``CMakeLists.txt``:

    FIND_PACKAGE(PkgConfig)

Then, insert the following [PKG_CHECK_MODULES](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/module/FindPkgConfig.html) command in your ``CMakeLists.txt`` file to tell CMake to resolve pkg-config dependencies for a specific package:

    PKG_CHECK_MODULES(GLIB2 REQUIRED glib-2.0>=2.36.0)

The command will export several variables, including the `XXX_LIBRARIES` command that can be used in [`TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES`](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/command/target_link_libraries.html) commands.

    ADD_LIBRARY(mylib STATIC
        ${MY_LIBSRCS}
    )

    TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(mylib
        GLIB2_LIBRARIES
    )

Unfortunately, I was unable to get the include paths of libraries found through pkg-config to be added automatically to the include source paths just like it it when using the standard `FIND_PACKAGE` function, so I needed to add them explicitly:

    INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(
        GLIB2_INCLUDE_DIRS
    )


## Exporting dependencies towards external packages

Although CMake supports its [own mechanism to export dependencies](http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake:How_To_Find_Libraries), it is recommended to take advantage of the more generic pkg-config files.

CMake doesn't provide any specific mechanism to generate `.pc` files.

However, one can take advantage of CMake variables substitution to generate a specific pkg-config file from a predefined template.

    CONFIGURE_FILE(
      "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/pkg-config.pc.cmake"
      "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${PROJECT_NAME}.pc"
    )

A typical `.pc` template could be:

    Name: ${PROJECT_NAME}
    Description: ${PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}
    Version: ${PROJECT_VERSION}
    Requires: ${PKG_CONFIG_REQUIRES}
    prefix=${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}
    includedir=${PKG_CONFIG_INCLUDEDIR}
    libdir=${PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR}
    Libs: ${PKG_CONFIG_LIBS}
    Cflags: ${PKG_CONFIG_CFLAGS}

Where the following variables are provided by CMake:

- `PROJECT_NAME` 
- `PROJECT_DESCRIPTION` 
- `PROJECT_VERSION`
- `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`

And these ones need to be specified explicitly:

- `PKG_CONFIG_REQUIRES`
- `PKG_CONFIG_INCLUDEDIR`
- `PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR`
- `PKG_CONFIG_LIBS`
- `PKG_CONFIG_CFLAGS`

Example:

    SET(PKG_CONFIG_REQUIRES glib-2.0)
    SET(PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR
        "\${prefix}/lib"
    )
    SET(PKG_CONFIG_INCLUDEDIR
        "\${prefix}/include/mylib"
    )
    SET(PKG_CONFIG_LIBS
        "-L\${libdir} -lmylib"
    )
    SET(PKG_CONFIG_CFLAGS
        "-I\${includedir}"
    )

    CONFIGURE_FILE(
      "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/pkg-config.pc.cmake"
      "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${PROJECT_NAME}.pc"
    )

## Installing files on target

Installing files on target is as simple as adding the corresponding [`INSTALL`](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/command/install.html) command to the target `CMakeLists.txt`.

To install the main targets of a project, use the `TARGETS` directive:

    INSTALL(TARGETS myapp
            DESTINATION bin)

or

    INSTALL(TARGETS mylib ARCHIVE
            DESTINATION lib)

>Note: The files will be installed relatively to the path specified in the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` cmake variable, prepended by the `DESTDIR` variable passed on the command line (ie `make install DESTDIR=/home/toto`)

Other project files can also be installed using the `FILES` directive:

    INSTALL(FILES header.h
            DESTINATION include/mylib)

or

    INSTALL(FILES "${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/${PROJECT_NAME}.pc"
            DESTINATION lib/pkgconfig)

## Building the project

I personnally always recommend to build a project out-of-tree, ie to put all build subproducts into a separate directory. Incidentally, building out-of-tree is also a good way to find out if your project is properly configured ...

So, the first step is to create a build directory

~~~
mkdir build && cd build
~~~

Then you need to tell CMake to generate the project makefiles according to specific directives you may specify on the command line (typically by setting variables).
Most of the time, you can let CMake apply default values:

~~~
cmake ..
~~~

But you may need for instance to specify a custom installation prefix (by default CMake will use `usr/local`):

~~~
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=usr ..
~~~

Once the makefiles have been generated you can simply build the project using make commands.

~~~
make
~~~

Finally, you can install the targets, either using defaults ...

~~~
make install
~~~

... or specifying the destination directory (CMake use `/` as the default destination directory)

~~~
DESTDIR=/custom-destdir make install
~~~
